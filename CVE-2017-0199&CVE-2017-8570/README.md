Given the fact that CVE-2017-8570 is CVE-2017-0199's patch bypass,and they are confusing so I just put them together.There are two ways to trigger CVE-2017-0199:HTAfile object in RTF and script object in ppsx.CVE-2017-8570 takes advantage of the scriptletfile object to bypass the patch.However,many anti-virus software and security researchers have not figure out the difference between these two vulnerabilities,thinking that CVE-2017-8570 is script object in ppsx,in fact it's still CVE-2017-0199.For example, this article:http://www.freebuf.com/news/143206.html is totally wrong.I made a CVE-2017-8570's poc myself:)After patching CVE-2017-0199(do not patch CVE-2017-8570),put test.xml under C:\t\test.xml and it will pop calc.exe.Read reference for more information.
