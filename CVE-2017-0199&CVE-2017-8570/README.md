Given the fact that CVE-2017-8570 is CVE-2017-0199's patch bypass,and they are confusing so I just put them together.There are two ways to trigger CVE-2017-0199:HTAfile objects in RTF and script objects in ppsx.CVE-2017-8570 takes advantage of the scriptfile object in RTF to bypass the patch.However,many anti-virus software and security researchers have not figure out the difference between these two vulnerabilities,thinking that CVE-2017-8570 is script object in ppsx,in fact it's still CVE-2017-0199.For example, this article:http://www.freebuf.com/news/143206.html is total wrong.Microsoft put two bugs under one CVE,and divide CVE-2017-0199's patch into two parts, one for Office patch (modify MSO.dll),one for Windows patch(mainly ole32.dll),both two patches must be installed to guarantee not affected by CVE-2017-0199.What Microsoft did is confusing,and we cannot simply blame anti-virus software and security researchers.Read reference for more information.


The two samples given here exploit CVE-2017-0199, one for RTF and one for ppsx.It's easy to make CVE-2017-8570's poc yourself if you read the reference.
