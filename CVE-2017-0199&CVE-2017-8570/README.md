Given the fact that CVE-2017-8570 is CVE-2017-0199's patch bypass,and they are confusing so I just put them together.For example,this article:http://www.freebuf.com/news/143206.html is totally wrong.I made a CVE-2017-8570's poc myself:)After patching CVE-2017-0199(do not patch CVE-2017-8570),put test.sct under C:\t\test.sct and open CVE-2017-8570.rtf,it will pop calc.exe.Read reference for more information.
