Given the fact that both CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 are stackoverflow in EQNEDT32.EXE so I just put them together.

CVE-2018-0802 in fact including two bug:stackoverflow during font name parse and stackoverflow during matrix record parse.Again,Microsoft put two bugs under one CVE.25a473ec43acfe80182d3fd6cd9cf87ac362a18b78a554bf1dda8d9dc05bee08 mentioned in tencent's blog exploit both CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802(font name);cve-2018-0802 poc with aslr-bypass.rtf and cve-2018-0802 poc with comments.rtf exploit CVE-2018-0802(matrix record).Microsoft add ASLR and fix serveral strcpy in 2017.11's patch but clearly not enough.So they remove this component in 2018.1's patch.
